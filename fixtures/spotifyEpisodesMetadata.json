        "description": "In this episode we learn about the licensing strategies of Anchor (which belongs to Spotify) and how it affects podcasters.While Anchor is a great platform for beginners, there are some caveats to be aware of before signing up. The reason is that Anchor has a non-exclusive license, which means that they can use your content in any way they want, including selling it to third parties. They can also use your content to promote the service, which is a bit of a double edged sword. On the one hand, it's great that they're promoting the service, but on the other hand, they're using your content to do it -- at no additional cost to them.Furthermore, if you want to move your podcast to another platform, you need to update all links in Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, etc.As an alternative our Proxy allows you to change the URL transparently and clients won&rsquo;t see a change.In general it's a good idea to do some research before signing up for a hosting and to think about open source platforms which can be hosted on your own and provide statistics which can be exported.LinksAnchor Terms of ServiceOpen Podcast on GithubHostsMatthias Endler (https://twitter.com/matthiasendler)&nbsp;Wolfgang Gassler (https://twitter.com/schafele)FeedbackEmail: echo@openpodcast.dev&nbsp;Twitter: https://twitter.com/OpenPodcastDev&nbsp;CreditsThe theme music is &ldquo;Orbiting A Distant Planet'' by Quantum Jazz and is licensed under a Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 International License.",
